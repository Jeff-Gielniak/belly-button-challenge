# Belly Button Challenge

This exercise requires reading through a JSON file and pulling out data from different samples of bacteria found in human navels.  Using the JSON file, the app allows the user to pull each sample from a drop down menu, which in turn populates a panel on that sample, as well as generates the following two graphs:
-A Bubblegraph showing the number of bacteria present for each OTU in that sample number
-A Bar chart showing the number of Bacteria for each of the top 10 OTUs for that sample

The charts and panel will update automatically when the dropdown menu is changed.
